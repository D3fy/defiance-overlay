		kvmtool is a lightweight tool for hosting KVM guests. As a pure virtualization
		tool it only supports guests using the same architecture, though it supports
		running 32-bit guests on those 64-bit architectures that allow this.

		From the original announcement email:
		-------------------------------------------------------
		The goal of this tool is to provide a clean, from-scratch, lightweight
		KVM host tool implementation that can boot Linux guest images (just a
		hobby, won't be big and professional like QEMU) with no BIOS
		dependencies and with only the minimal amount of legacy device
		emulation.

		It's great as a learning tool if you want to get your feet wet in
		virtualization land: it's only 5 KLOC of clean C code that can already
		boot a guest Linux image.

		Right now it can boot a Linux image and provide you output via a serial
		console, over the host terminal, i.e. you can use it to boot a guest
		Linux image in a terminal or over ssh and log into the guest without
		much guest or host side setup work needed.
