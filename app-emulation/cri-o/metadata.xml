		CRI-O is meant to provide an integration path between OCI conformant runtimes and
		the kubelet. Specifically, it implements the Kubelet Container Runtime Interface
		(CRI) using OCI conformant runtimes. The scope of CRI-O is tied to the scope of
		the CRI.

		At a high level, we expect the scope of CRI-O to be restricted to the following
		functionalities:

		Support multiple image formats including the existing Docker image format
		Support for multiple means to download images including trust and image verification
		Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc)
		Container process lifecycle management
		Monitoring and logging required to satisfy the CRI
		Resource isolation as required by the CRI
