		While most of the tools used in the Linux containers ecosystem are written in
		Go, I believe C is a better fit for a lower level tool like a container
		runtime. runc, the most used implementation of the OCI runtime specs written
		in Go, re-execs itself and use a module written in C for setting up the
		environment before the container process starts.

		crun aims to be also usable as a library that can be easily included in
		programs without requiring an external process for managing OCI containers.
