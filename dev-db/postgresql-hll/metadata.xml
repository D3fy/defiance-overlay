		This Postgres module introduces a new data type hll which is a HyperLogLog
		data structure. HyperLogLog is a fixed-size, set-like structure used for
		distinct value counting with tunable precision. For example, in 1280 bytes hll
		can estimate the count of tens of billions of distinct values with only a few
		percent error.

		In addition to the algorithm proposed in the original paper, this
		implementation is augmented to improve its accuracy and memory use without
		sacrificing much speed. See below for more details.

		This postgresql-hll extension was originally developed by the Science team
		from Aggregate Knowledge, now a part of Neustar. Please see the
		acknowledgements section below for details about its contributors.
