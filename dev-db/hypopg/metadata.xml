		HypoPG is a PostgreSQL extension adding support for hypothetical indexes.

		An hypothetical, or virtual, index is an index that doesn't really exists,
		and thus doesn't cost CPU, disk or any resource to create. They're useful
		to know if specific indexes can increase performance for problematic queries,
		since you can know if PostgreSQL will use these indexes or not without
		having to spend resources to create them.
