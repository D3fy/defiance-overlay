		What is Citus?

		- Open-source PostgreSQL extension (not a fork)
		- Scalable across multiple machines through sharding and replication
		- Distributed engine for query parallelization
		- Database designed to scale multi-tenant applications

		Citus is a distributed database that scales across commodity servers using
		transparent sharding and replication. Citus extends the underlying database
		rather than forking it, giving developers and enterprises the power and
		familiarity of a relational database. As an extension, Citus supports new
		PostgreSQL releases, and allows you to benefit from new features while
		maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.
