		When writing test suites for modules that operate on files, it's often
		inconvenient to correctly create a platform-independent temporary storage
		space, manipulate files inside it, then clean it up when the test exits.
		The inconvenience usually results in tests that don't work everywhere,
		or worse, no tests at all.

		This module aims to eliminate that problem by making it easy to do
		things right.
