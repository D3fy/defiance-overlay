		Gazelle is a PSGI Handler. It is derivied from Starlet. A lot of its code was
		rewritten or optimized by converting it to XS code.

		Gazelle supports following features:

		- Supports HTTP/1.1. (Without Keepalive support.)
		- Ultra fast HTTP processing using picohttpparser.
		- Uses accept4(2) if the operating system supports it.
		- Uses writev(2) for output responses.
		- Prefork and graceful shutdown using Parallel::Prefork.
		- Hot deploy and unix domain socket using Server::Starter.
		- Gazelle is suitable for running HTTP application servers behind a reverse
		proxy such as nginx.

		One can find a Benchmark here:
