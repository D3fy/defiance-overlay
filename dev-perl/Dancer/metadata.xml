		Dancer is a web application framework designed to be as effortless as possible
		for the developer, taking care of the boring bits as easily as possible, yet
		staying out of your way and letting you get on with writing your code.

		Dancer aims to provide the simplest way for writing web applications, and
		offers the flexibility to scale between a very simple lightweight web service
		consisting of a few lines of code in a single file, all the way up to a more
		complex fully-fledged web application with session support, templates for
		views and layouts, etc.

		If you don't want to write CGI scripts by hand, and find Catalyst too big or
		cumbersome for your project, Dancer is what you need.

		Dancer has few pre-requisites, so your Dancer webapps will be easy to deploy.

		Dancer apps can be used with an embedded web server (great for easy testing),
		and can run under PSGI/Plack for easy deployment in a variety of webserver
		environments.
