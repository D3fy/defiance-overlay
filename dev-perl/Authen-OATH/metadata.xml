		Implementation of the HOTP and TOTP One Time Password algorithms as
		defined by OATH (http://www.openauthentication.org)

		All necessary parameters are set by default, though these can be
		overridden. Both totp() and htop() have passed all of the test vectors
		defined in the RFC documents for TOTP and HOTP.

		totp() and hotp() both default to returning 6 digits and using SHA1.
		As such, both can be called by passing only the secret key and a valid
		OTP will be returned.
