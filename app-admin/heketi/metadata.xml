		Heketi provides a RESTful management interface which can be used to manage
		the life cycle of GlusterFS volumes. With Heketi, cloud services like
		OpenStack Manila, Kubernetes, and OpenShift can dynamically provision
		GlusterFS volumes with any of the supported durability types. Heketi will
		automatically determine the location for bricks across the cluster, making
		sure to place bricks and its replicas across different failure domains.
		Heketi also supports any number of GlusterFS clusters, allowing cloud
		services to provide network file storage without being limited to a single
		GlusterFS cluster.
