		Curve - authentication and encryption library
		Curve implements the CurveZMQ elliptic curve security mechanism, for use in ZeroMQ applications. This library is primarily a reference implementation for the CurveZMQ specification but may also be used for end-to-end security.

		The ZeroMQ core library has its own implementation of CurveZMQ over TCP, since July 2013. The Curve library is intended:

		To facilitate CurveZMQ implementations in other languages by providing a reference implementation.
		To provide security for older versions of ZeroMQ.
		To provide end-to-end security over untrusted intermediaries, for instance between two chat clients connected over a public ZeroMQ-based chat server.
		To provide security over other transports that fit the one-to-one model (it will not work over multicast).
