		ctap is an easy way to get Perl-style TAP testing convenience in C.
		It ships as a standalone shared library that you can link to your
		tests, and a header file that contains functions and macros for doing
		things like assertions, skip/todo blocks and dynamic evaluation.

		ctap stays out of your way, letting you focus on writing tests
