		This is a C version of Bob Jenkin's spooky hash. The only advantage over
		Bob's original version is that it is in C, not C++ and comes with some
		test and benchmark code.

		This is a very competitive hash function, but is somewhat unportable (64bit
		little endian only). It's more portable than some of the contenders like
		CityHash.

		Quoting Bobs original description: SpookyHash: a 128-bit noncryptographic
		hash function By Bob Jenkins, public domain
